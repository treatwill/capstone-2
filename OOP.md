Object Oriented Programming Concept Questions

As you should know by now, there are 4 principles (pillars) of Object Oriented Programming.

Please write a 1-3 paragraphs explaining these 4 concepts further.  Please provide a sufficient enough explanation about these pillars, as well as some examples to illustrate the practical use cases of these principles.  Please be aware, that any copy / pasting from websites can be easily detected.  Don't do that, but rather, explain the concepts in your own words, while providing code examples of each concept.

1. Encapsulation

2. Inheritance is as it sounds. It takes Class and takes/inherits the methods from the parent class. So basically a child element that takes from a parent element.

3. Abstraction
To me abstraction is taking one big chunk of something and breaking it down into smaller chunks to be done in the background. So when you need to call the operation you only need to worry about the bigger picture.

4. Polymorphism also has a parent child. But where it differs from inheritance is that each child has its own unique element that they can call as well as the parents elements.
