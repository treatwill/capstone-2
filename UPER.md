<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*Develop a game that has OOP and OOD properties.
*I am to make a plan of how to implement the four pillars of OOP into a game app to show that i understand.
*

*Research options and breakdown which project fits best.
*
*learn how to implement UI and which library would be best used.
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*I will be making a breakout app that implements lives, scores, difficulty options.

* i need 3 major classes to make game work.
  
* i need to add basic game logic such as moving, winning and losing.
  
* come up with any test to make sure game is running correctly
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* build parent class that come up with basic ui for game.

* build my ball, paddle, and brick class to play game.

* i watched a few tutorials and read over some online sources to get started.
  
* add levels with different designs for bricks.
*
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* im going to organize my code to correctly show OOD principle

* Write code in TDD fashion to lead to fewer errors in the future.
  
*refactor all of my logic classes to run more independently.
*

*Do more research before jumping in to have a cleaner finish
